### Hi there 👋

I am a doctoral researcher at Aalto University in Finland. My research area revolves around vehicle mechatronics, control engineering, electric and hybrid vehicles, electric and hybrid drivetrain, energy management, data analysis and machine learning.

M.Sc.(Tech.) in Automation and Electrical Engineering, B.Tech. in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 

I use GitHub in order to store and share some of the cool projects I have worked on, which range from electrification of internal combustion engine-driven vehicles through physics-based models to predicting music genres, bank telemarketing strategies and stock market prices via machine and deep learning models.

- 💻 I work primarily with MATLAB and Simulink for creating physics-based models but I use Python and R if I have to work on developing data-driven machine and deep learning models.
- 🏏 I am heavily involved with playing and officiating cricket matches in Finland 🇫🇮.
- 📍 You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subhadyutisahoo/).
- ♂️ Pronouns: he/him/his 🤠.
- 🗞️ **Fun fact**: Once upon a time, I have worked as a newspaper delivery boy! 

And, always remember that "***YOU ROCK!*** 🤘"
